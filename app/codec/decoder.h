 * @brief A decoder's is the main class for bringing external media into Olive
 *
 * Its responsibilities are to serve as
 * abstraction from codecs/decoders and provide complete frames. These frames can be video or audio data and are
 * provided as Frame objects in shared pointers to alleviate the responsibility of memory handling.
 *
 * The main function in a decoder is Retrieve() which should return complete image/audio data. A decoder should
 * alleviate all the complexities of codec compression from the rest of the application (i.e. a decoder should never
 * return a partial frame or require other parts of the system to interface directly with the codec). Often this will
 * necessitate pre-emptively caching, indexing, or even fully transcoding media before using it which can be implemented
 * through the Analyze() function.
 *
 * A decoder does NOT perform any pixel/sample format conversion. Frames should pass through the PixelService
 * to be utilized in the rest of the rendering pipeline.

   *
